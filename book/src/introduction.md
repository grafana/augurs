# Introduction

`augurs` is a Rust library for time series analysis and forecasting. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with time series data, including:

- Forecasting with multiple algorithms including ETS, MSTL, and Prophet
- Outlier detection using MAD and DBSCAN
- Time series clustering with DTW distance metrics
- Seasonality and changepoint detection
- Data preprocessing and transformation tools

Built with a focus on performance and ease of use, `augurs` offers both high-level APIs for common tasks and low-level components for custom implementations. The library supports Python and JavaScript bindings, making it accessible across different programming environments.

Whether you're building a production forecasting system or analyzing seasonal patterns in data, `augurs` provides the tools you need for robust time series analysis.

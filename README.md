This repository contains `augurs`, a time series framework built in Rust.
It aims to provide some useful primitives for working with time series,
as well as the main functionality: heavily optimized forecasting models
based on existing R or Python implementations.

As well as the core Rust library, augurs will provide bindings to other
languages such as Python and Javascript (via WASM).

*Status*: please note that this repository is very much in progress.
APIs are subject to change, and functionality may not be fully implemented.

## Releasing

Releases are made using `release-plz`: a PR should be automatically created for each release, and merging will perform the release and publish automatically.

### Releasing the `augurs` Python library

The first exception to the `release-plz` flow is the `augurs` Python library, which is only released when a new tag beginning with `pyaugurs` is pushed. This must be done manually for now (ideally soon after the `release-plz` PR is merged).

E.g.:

```
git tag pyaugurs-v0.2.0 -m "Release pyaugurs v0.2.0"
git push --tags
```

### Releasing the `augurs` npm library

The `augurs` npm library must also be published manually. This can be done using `just publish-npm`; note you'll need to login with npm first.

```
npm login
# Log in online, etc...
just publish-npm
```
